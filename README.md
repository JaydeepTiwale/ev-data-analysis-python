# Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis – Python Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores an electric vehicle (EV) dataset to extract insights, identify performance trends, and support customer decision-making. The tasks include data filtering, EDA, hypothesis testing, and an EV recommendation system using Python.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scipy (t-test), OOP for recommendation

## 🔍 Key Features

### ✅ Task Highlights:
- **Filtering** EVs based on budget and range
- **Grouping & Aggregation** by manufacturer
- **Outlier Detection** for energy consumption
- **Correlation & Scatterplots** between battery and range
- **Custom Recommendation Class** using user input
- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing** (Audi vs Tesla engine power)
